# PyPlot: Drawing a Sine Wave Animation
This repository contains a script that draws part of the sine wave sin(x).

## Exercises

1. Change the script so that sin(x) is drawn for the x values in the range [-4pi,4pi].

2. Add a green, dotted cos wave that draws at the same rate as the sine wave, on the same set of axes.
